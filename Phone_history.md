The following has been my succession of interesting Android phones. Mostly dual SIM Androids from China. At various stages, I have favored things like ultra long battery lives (Outkitel, Doogee) and IP68 waterproofing.

The Android smartphone market is fast evolving and just keeping up with the lastest advances takes time. Typically — probably through using a bunch of non-OEM chargers — my phone and charging speeds begin to slow down after 18 months or so and I invest in a new handset. 

| Phone #  | Link |  Notes | 
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | Oukitel K10000  | Named after its 10,000 mAh battery. Rather heavy and bulky but a good intro to the world of obscure phones! |
| 2 | Blackview BV6000S | First waterproof / IP68 phone. Got really slow | 
| 3 | Lost | A phone that I lost at an airport. Convincing proof that Snapdragon > Mediatek |  
| 4 |  Redmi |  Went for conventional specs for once |
